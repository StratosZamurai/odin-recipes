# odin-recipes
In this project, I am going to create an extremely basic recipes website.
This will demonstrate a barebones understanding of how to use HTML to create websites.
I will show my ability to make a basic structure of text, images, lists, and links on a webpage.
I will show my ability of organizing repositories into a simple website.
