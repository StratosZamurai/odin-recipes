            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>1 (9 inch) prepared graham cracker crust</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Pumpkin Layer:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Half cup pumpkin puree</li>
            <li>Half teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
            <li>1 pinch ground cloves, or more to taste</li>
            <li>1 pinch ground nutmeg, or more to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Make cheesecake layer: Beat cream cheese, sugar,
                and vanilla in a large bowl with an electric mixer 
                until smooth. Add eggs, one at a time, blending 
                well after each addition. Spread 1 cup batter in 
                the graham cracker crust.
            </li>
            <li>Make pumpkin layer: Add pumpkin puree, cinnamon, 
                cloves, and nutmeg to the remaining batter; stir 
                gently until well blended. Carefully spread on 
                top of plain cheesecake batter in the crust.
            </li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until the edges are 
                puffed and the surface is firm except for a small 
                spot in the center that jiggles when the pan is 
                gently shaken, 35 to 40 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>Remove from the oven, set on a wire rack, and 
                cool to room temperature, 1 to 2 hours.
            </li>
            <li>Refrigerate for at least 3 hours before serving,
                preferably overnight.
            </li>
        </ol>
